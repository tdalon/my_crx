# My CRX

Repository for my personal Chrome Extension.

It includes search functionality and quick action via the omnibar, using the 'm' keyword to trigger it.

Also some context menus are implemented on the extension icon, like Amazon to Goodreads.

## Examples

In the omnibar, type 'my' followed by {TAB}
